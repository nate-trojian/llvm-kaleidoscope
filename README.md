# LLVM Kaleidoscope Tutorials
## Description
I wanted to walkthrough the [LLVM Language Frontend Tutorial](https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/index.html) to learn more about the LLVM infrastructure.

This is my way of being able to keep track of the changes made and be able to walk backwards through it all.

## Usage
### Prerequisites
Download and install LLVM

`http://releases.llvm.org/`

I am using version 9.0.0

### Build
To build the sources

`make`

To run the REPL

`./main`
